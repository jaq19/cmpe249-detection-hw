Homework: 2D Object Detection — SOTA Evaluation or Open-Source Model Analysis Objective

The goal of this homework is to develop a technical understanding of modern 2D object detection. Ref our tutorial as the starting point: [linkLinks to an external site.]

Choose ONE track based on your available computing resources:

    Track A — Experimental Track: If you have access to a GPU, run and evaluate modern object detection models. Training/fine-tuning is encouraged but not required; meaningful inference and cross-dataset evaluation are acceptable.
    Track B — Code & Architecture Analysis Track: If you do not have sufficient GPU resources, perform a detailed technical analysis of real open-source detector implementations.

Track B is NOT a simple literature survey. You must inspect actual source code and connect the implementation to the papers and model architecture.

AI tools are allowed and encouraged, but your submission must demonstrate real technical investigation and understanding. 
Track A — Experimental Model Evaluation

Choose this track if you have access to a GPU, cloud GPU, or other suitable accelerator.
Requirements
1. Models

Evaluate at least 3 model configurations from at least 2 different detector families.

Examples:

    Faster R-CNN / Mask R-CNN
    RetinaNet / FCOS
    YOLOv8 / YOLO11
    DETR / Deformable DETR / RT-DETR
    Grounding DINO / OWLv2 / YOLO-World

Three sizes of the same model do not count as three detector families.
2. Datasets

Evaluate on at least 2 datasets or domains.

Recommended datasets include:

    COCO
    KITTI
    nuImages
    nuScenes
    Waymo

A recommended experiment is:

COCO-pretrained detector → autonomous-driving dataset without retraining

This allows you to study domain shift and generalization.

If datasets use different class definitions, clearly document your label/taxonomy mapping.
3. Metrics

Report appropriate metrics such as:

    mAP@[0.50:0.95]
    AP50 / AP75
    AP small / medium / large
    per-class AP
    AR
    inference latency / FPS
    GPU memory, if measurable

4. Reproducibility

For each major experiment, report:

    model and checkpoint
    dataset and split
    input resolution
    confidence/NMS thresholds
    hardware
    framework/version
    exact command or configuration

Screenshots alone are not sufficient.
5. Technical Analysis

Perform at least two of the following:

    Cross-dataset generalization: Which classes or object scales degrade most?
    Architecture comparison: e.g., YOLO vs. RT-DETR or Faster R-CNN vs. FCOS.
    Closed-set vs. open-vocabulary: e.g., YOLO vs. Grounding DINO/YOLO-World.
    Speed–accuracy tradeoff: Compare latency, memory, and accuracy.
    Fine-tuning: Compare pretrained/zero-shot performance with fine-tuned performance.

Track B — Open-Source Code & Architecture Analysis

Choose this track if you do not have sufficient GPU resources.

This track requires a code-level technical survey, not just paper summaries.
Requirements
1. Models

Analyze at least 4 models from at least 3 detector families.

A good selection might include:

    Faster R-CNN
    FCOS or RetinaNet
    YOLOv8/YOLO11
    DETR/RT-DETR
    Grounding DINO/YOLO-World

Depth is more important than analyzing many models.
2. Study Real Open-Source Implementations

Use official or established repositories such as: official author repositories

For each model, identify:

    paper
    repository
    framework
    main model-definition file/class
    backbone implementation
    neck implementation
    detection head
    loss implementation
    inference/post-processing implementation

Include actual file paths, class names, and important function names.
3. Trace the Model Pipeline

For each model, trace the actual implementation:

Image → Backbone → Multi-scale Features → Neck → Detection Head → Loss/Prediction → Post-processing → Final Detections

Create your own architecture diagram based on the source code you inspected, not simply a copied paper figure.
4. Analyze the Key Technical Components

Explain and compare:

Architecture

    backbone
    FPN/PAN/other neck
    detection head
    anchor-based vs. anchor-free vs. query-based

Training

    target assignment
    classification loss
    box regression loss
    focal loss
    IoU/GIoU/CIoU
    Distribution Focal Loss
    Hungarian matching, where applicable

Inference

    confidence thresholding
    box decoding
    NMS or NMS-free inference
    top-K selection
    resizing boxes to original coordinates

For open-vocabulary detectors, also trace:

Text prompt → text encoder → vision-language interaction → detection score
5. Target Assignment Comparison

Compare at least 3 target-assignment strategies, such as:

    anchor/IoU matching
    center sampling
    task-aligned assignment
    Hungarian matching
    query matching

Explain why this is an important difference among detector families.
6. Code-Level Comparison Table

Include a comparison table containing items such as:
Property 	Faster R-CNN 	FCOS 	YOLO11 	RT-DETR
Backbone 				
Neck 				
Anchor-based? 				
Target assignment 				
Classification loss 				
Box loss 				
Object queries? 				
NMS? 				
Main source file/class 				
7. One Required Deep Dive

Choose ONE:

    Anchor-based → Anchor-free: How did target assignment and prediction change?
    YOLO → DETR: Why does YOLO typically use NMS while DETR can be NMS-free?
    DETR → Deformable/RT-DETR: What changes improve convergence and efficiency?
    Closed-set → Open-vocabulary: How is a fixed classification head replaced by text-conditioned detection?

Your explanation must reference actual source code.
8. Source-Code Evidence

Include at least 8 specific code references, for example:

    Repository → file → class/function → what the code does → why it matters.

Do not simply provide GitHub links or screenshots.
References

For either track, use at least 8 credible technical references, including:

    at least 4 original research papers
    at least 2 official repositories/framework documentation sources

Foundational papers are acceptable when discussing architectural evolution, but include recent models where appropriate.
AI Tool Usage

ChatGPT, Claude, Codex, and other AI tools are allowed and encouraged.

Good uses of AI include:

    understanding unfamiliar source code
    locating model components
    comparing a paper with its implementation
    debugging experiments
    generating scripts to inspect tensor shapes
    analyzing unexpected results
    challenging your technical explanation

You are responsible for verifying AI-generated explanations against the actual paper, code, and experimental results.
Submission

Submit one PDF as either:

    a 6–10 page technical report, or
    a 15–25 slide technical presentation.

Track A should include:

    Models and datasets
    Experimental setup and hardware
    Commands/configurations
    Quantitative results
    At least two technical analyses
    Failure analysis
    Conclusions
    References

Also submit/link your experiment code, configuration, or command log.
Track B should include:

    Detector evolution/taxonomy
    Selected papers and repositories
    Code-derived architecture diagrams
    Backbone/neck/head analysis
    Loss and target-assignment analysis
    Inference/post-processing analysis
    Code-level comparison table
    One deep-dive topic
    At least 8 specific source-code references
    Conclusions
    References

Minimum Quality Requirement

Track A: You must provide evidence that you actually ran the experiments. Copied benchmark numbers or detection screenshots alone are not sufficient.

Track B: You must provide evidence that you actually inspected the source code. AI-generated paper summaries, copied architecture diagrams, benchmark tables, or lists of GitHub links are not sufficient.

I am not grading based on who has the most powerful GPU.

For Track A, the key question is:

    Can you design, reproduce, and critically analyze a meaningful object-detection experiment?

For Track B:

    Can you read a modern deep-learning codebase and connect the implementation to the ideas described in the paper?

Both tracks require real technical understanding.
